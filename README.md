# 🖥️ C Codes – My C Programming Journey

Welcome to my **C programming practice repository**.  
This repo contains solutions to problems and exercises I worked on while learning C — covering every major topic, condition, and concept.

It’s not just a collection of codes, but a reflection of how I’ve learned to **think like a programmer**.

## 📖 About

This repository contains all the **C programming codes** I wrote while following a structured course.  
Each file represents my learning progress, from the basics to more advanced concepts, ensuring I clearly understand each term, condition, and topic.

## 📚 Topics Covered

Some of the key areas explored in this repo:

- **Basic Syntax** – Input/output, variables, data types.
- **Operators & Expressions** – Arithmetic, relational, logical operators.
- **Control Flow** – `if-else`, `switch`, loops (`for`, `while`, `do-while`).
- **Functions** – Reusable blocks of logic, recursion.
- **Arrays & Strings** – Data storage, manipulation, searching, sorting.
- **Pointers** – Memory management, dynamic allocation.
- **Structures & Unions** – Grouping data logically.
- **File Handling** – Reading/writing data to files.

## 🌍 Why C Matters

C is called the **“mother of programming languages”** because:

- It forms the foundation for **modern languages** like C++, Java, and Python.
- Operating systems (like **Linux, Windows**) and many embedded systems are built with C.
- Learning C improves **problem-solving** and understanding of how computers really work.

## 🏠 Applications in Daily Life

The concepts I practiced in this repo are not just academic — they apply to real-world problems:

- **Loops & Conditions** → Automated billing systems, calculators, traffic light control.
- **Arrays & Strings** → Handling lists like contacts, inventory, or daily expenses.
- **Functions** → Reusable logic, like computing EMI, temperature conversions, or grade calculations.
- **Pointers & Memory** → Powering embedded systems in cars, smart devices, or even ATMs.
- **File Handling** → Saving notes, storing transaction histories, or logging app usage.

Every small program is a **step toward building larger systems** that impact daily life.
